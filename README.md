## 1. Project

  I aim to develop and test a platform to enable individuals life by setting and planning their goals. “Failing to plan is planning to fail”; “You become what you think about most of the time”.  
  This platform will enable people to edit their goals, store them according to priority. The Individual is encouraged to use a forum to publish accomplishments.


## 2. UX

  * __Typography__

    Fonts selected:  
    _Red Rose_ for title;  
    _Noto Sans_ throughout work;

  * __Colour Scheme__
  
    Orange is the most energetic colour and for this reason it was selected a colour scheme with orange tones with use of [ adobe color ](color.adobe.com).
