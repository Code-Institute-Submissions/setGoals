## 1. Project

  I aim to develop and test a platform to enable individuals life by setting and planning their goals. “Failing to plan is planning to fail”; “You become what you think about most of the time”.  
  This platform will enable people to edit their goals, store them according to priority. The Individual is encouraged to use a forum to publish accomplishments.


## 2. UX

### 2.1 __Typography__

    Fonts selected:  
    _Red Rose_ for title;  
    _Noto Sans_ throughout work;

### 2.2 __Colour Scheme__: 
__Blue__ is the most popular colour and __orange__ is the most energetic colour.  
Setting goals requires both a desire for improvement and energy to do so, and for this reason it was selected a trending scheme colour including both, blue and orange using [ adobe color ](color.adobe.com) software.
