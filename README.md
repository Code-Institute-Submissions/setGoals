## 1. Project

  I aim to develop and test a platform to enable individuals life by setting and planning their goals. “Failing to plan is planning to fail”; “You become what you think about most of the time”.  
  This platform will enable people to edit their goals, store them according to priority. The Individual is encouraged to use a forum to publish accomplishments.
