## Project

   I aim to develop and test a platform to enable individuals life by setting and planning their goals. “Failing to plan is planning to fail”; “You become what you think about most of the time”.  
   This platform will enable people to edit their goals, store them according to priority. The Individual is encouraged to use a forum to publish accomplishments.
